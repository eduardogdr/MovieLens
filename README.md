# MovieLens 

The Movie Lens project is part of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course. The aim of the project is to develop and train a recommendation machine learning algorithm to predict a rating given by a user to a set of movies in the data set. The Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. This report will present methods used in exploratory data analysis and visualization, results for the RMSE model and a conclusion based on results of the model.
